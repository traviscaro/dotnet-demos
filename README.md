# dotnet-demos

Hello and welcome to my repository, where I embark on an exploration journey through the vast landscape of C# and .NET, sprinkled with a variety of other technologies and programming concepts. This repository is my personal workspace, a place where I experiment, learn, and grow as a developer.

## Overview

This project is a collection of mini-projects, each designed to tackle different programming concepts, design patterns, and technologies. It's a mixed bag hereâ€”ranging from core programming fundamentals to exploring the latest in cloud infrastructure and beyond. My goal is to build a diverse skill set, not just within the .NET ecosystem but also in other areas that intersect with the world of software development.

In this journey, I'm also stepping outside the .NET realm to embrace technologies and concepts that are crucial for a well-rounded understanding of modern software development. From infrastructure as code with Terraform and Pulumi to mastering data strategies like sharding and replication, this repository is a playground for a wide array of technologies.

## The Roadmap

Here's a structured guide through the myriad of concepts I plan to explore. This roadmap is ever-evolving, reflecting the dynamic nature of technology and my continuous learning journey.

### Core Programming Fundamentals

Basics like Variables, Loops, Arrays
Object-Oriented Concepts: Classes, Inheritance, Interfaces

- **Simple Bank System**: A console application simulating basic banking operations (deposits, withdrawals, balance checks) to practice variables, loops, and arrays.

### Advanced Concepts

Asynchronous Programming with Async/Await
Data Querying with LINQ
Leveraging Generics for flexible code

- **Task Manager**: An application that leverages async/await for managing and tracking asynchronous tasks.

### Software Design

Embracing SOLID principles and Design Patterns for elegant solutions

- **Inventory Management System**: Utilize SOLID principles and design patterns like Repository and Factory in an application managing products, sales, and stock levels.

### Broadening Horizons

Exploring Microservices and Serverless architectures
Diving into Cloud Deployment with tools like Terraform and Pulumi
Automating workflows with CI/CD practices

- **Microservices Blog Platform**: Create a blog platform with a microservices architecture, separating functionalities like posting, commenting, and user management into different services.
- **Serverless Data Processing**: Implement a serverless architecture using AWS Lambda or Azure Functions for event-triggered data processing tasks.

### Web Development Essentials

Mastering web protocols: REST, GraphQL
Enhancing user experience with Real-Time communication using SignalR, WebSockets
Ensuring reliability with Testing Tools: Selenium, Cypress, Playwright

- **Real-Time Chat Application**: A web application using SignalR or WebSockets for real-time user communication.
- **Automated Web Testing Suite**: Automated tests for a web application using Selenium, Cypress, or Playwright.

### Data Mastery

Data Access and Management with Entity Framework
Advanced Data Handling: Sharding, Replication
Understanding Consistency with CAP, ACID, BASE

- **Data Visualization Dashboard**: A dashboard application that displays data from various sources using charts and graphs, showcasing LINQ queries and data manipulation.
- **Distributed Database Simulator**: Simulate data sharding, replication, and partitioning in a mock distributed database environment.

### Performance and Reliability
